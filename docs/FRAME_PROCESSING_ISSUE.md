# Video Frame Processing Issue in SingleCameraDetector

## Issue Description

During testing of the C++ implementation of the Smart Office Security System, we encountered an issue with frame acquisition in the `SingleCameraDetector` class. The specific error message was:

```
Could not get first frame. Output will not be saved.
Starting detection loop...
End of video or camera disconnected

=== Detection Statistics ===
Total frames processed: 0
Detections: 0
Average FPS: 0.0
Total processing time: 0.0 seconds
```

This occurs when:
1. The application successfully loads the model and labels
2. The camera processor is initialized correctly
3. However, the `getFrame()` method fails to retrieve frames from the camera or video file

## Technical Details

### Affected Components

1. **SingleCameraDetector** - Fails to process frames from the video source
2. **CameraProcessor** - `getFrame()` method fails to return valid frames
3. **cv::VideoWriter** - Cannot be initialized due to missing first frame

### Debugging Steps Taken

1. Fixed path issues in `main.cpp` to correctly reference model and labels files
2. Added additional constructors to `CameraProcessor` to handle different source types
3. Added the `getFrame()` method to `CameraProcessor` class for direct frame access
4. Updated SingleCameraDetector to store model and label paths as member variables
5. Ensured proper error handling in all involved methods

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be related to how frames are accessed from the camera processor. Specifically:

1. The `CameraProcessor::getFrame()` method may be trying to access `lastFrame` before it's populated
2. The frame queue may not be properly managed in a multi-threaded context
3. OpenCV may have issues with the specific video file format or codec

### Update After Initial Fix

After implementing fixes to better handle empty frames in `getFrame()` and to retry frame acquisition, the application progressed further but encountered a segmentation fault during the processing loop:

```
Model path: ../models/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_quant_postprocess_edgetpu.tflite
Labels path: ../models/coco_labels.txt
Running in single camera mode
Initializing single camera detector for video file ../videos/sample.mp4
...
Camera -1 opened: 640x360 @ 20 FPS
Attempt 1 to get first frame...
Saving output to output/sample_processed_20250316_200853.mp4
Starting detection loop...
Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```

This suggests that:
1. The frame acquisition fix was successful (able to get the first frame)
2. The video writer was successfully initialized
3. However, a memory access violation is occurring in the processing loop

Potential causes for the segmentation fault:
1. Accessing an uninitialized pointer or null pointer
2. Race condition in the multi-threaded code
3. Memory corruption, possibly related to the frame queue

## Proposed Solutions

### Short-term Fixes

1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Modify the `getFrame()` method to handle the case when no frames are available:

```cpp
cv::Mat CameraProcessor::getFrame() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(lastFrameMutex);
    if (lastFrame.empty()) {
        // Try to read a frame directly
        cv::Mat frame;
        if (cap.isOpened() && cap.read(frame)) {
            lastFrame = frame.clone();
            return lastFrame;
        }
        std::cerr << "No frames available in getFrame()" << std::endl;
    }
    return lastFrame.clone();
}
```

2. **Initialization Check**: Add a check in `SingleCameraDetector::run()` to verify that the first frame can be acquired:

```cpp
// Try to get a frame multiple times before giving up
for (int attempt = 0; attempt < 5; attempt++) {
    cv::Mat firstFrame = cameraProcessor->getFrame();
    if (!firstFrame.empty()) {
        // Use the frame
        break;
    }
    std::cerr << "Attempt " << attempt + 1 << " to get first frame failed. Retrying..." << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(500));
}
```

3. **Direct Video Reading**: For video files, consider using OpenCV's VideoCapture directly in the `SingleCameraDetector` class instead of abstracting through `CameraProcessor`:

```cpp
if (!isCamera) {
    // For video files, use VideoCapture directly
    cv::VideoCapture directCap(source);
    if (!directCap.isOpened()) {
        std::cerr << "Failed to open video file directly: " << source << std::endl;
        return;
    }
    
    // Process video frames directly
    while (isRunning) {
        cv::Mat frame;
        if (!directCap.read(frame) || frame.empty()) {
            break;
        }
        // Process frame
    }
}
```

### Additional Fixes for the Segmentation Fault

1. **Null Pointer Check**: Add defensive checks in `processFrame` and main loop to avoid dereferencing null pointers:

```cpp
cv::Mat SingleCameraDetector::processFrame(const cv::Mat& frame) {
    // Check for valid input
    if (frame.empty()) {
        std::cerr << "Warning: Received empty frame in processFrame()" << std::endl;
        return cv::Mat(); // Return empty mat to indicate error
    }
    
    // Clone the frame to avoid modifying the original
    cv::Mat outputFrame = frame.clone();
    
    // Rest of the processing...
}
```

2. **Safe Model Access**: Ensure the model is not accessed if null:

```cpp
// Run detection
std::vector<Detection> detections;

if (model) {
    try {
        detections = model->processImage(frame, threshold);
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error in model processing: " << e.what() << std::endl;
    }
} else {
    std::cerr << "Warning: Model is null in processFrame()" << std::endl;
}
```

3. **Thread Safety**: Review thread synchronization in CameraProcessor to ensure thread safety:

```cpp
// In the main loop
while (isRunning) {
    // Get frame from camera with explicit error handling
    cv::Mat frame;
    try {
        frame = cameraProcessor->getFrame();
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error getting frame: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        break;
    }
    
    // Check if frame is valid
    if (frame.empty()) {
        std::cout << "End of video or camera disconnected" << std::endl;
        break;
    }
    
    // Process frame with detection and explicit error handling
    cv::Mat processedFrame;
    try {
        processedFrame = processFrame(frame);
    } catch (const std::exception& e) {
        std::cerr << "Error processing frame: " << e.what() << std::endl;
        continue;
    }
    
    // Rest of the loop...
}
```

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Refactor Camera Abstraction**: Consider redesigning the camera abstraction to handle different source types more effectively:
   - Create separate classes for camera devices and video files
   - Use a common interface for frame acquisition
   - Add better diagnostics for frame reading issues

2. **Enhanced Video File Support**: Improve video file handling:
   - Add support for more codecs and formats
   - Include video file information (frame count, duration, etc.)
   - Add better progress reporting for video file processing

3. **Synchronization Mechanisms**: Review and improve thread synchronization:
   - Ensure proper mutex locking for shared resources
   - Add condition variables for signaling between threads
   - Consider lock-free data structures for performance

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with various video file formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.)
2. Test with different codecs (H.264, MJPEG, VP9, etc.)
3. Test with various camera devices
4. Add logging to track frame acquisition and processing
