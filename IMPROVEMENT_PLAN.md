# Dual Camera Detector Improvement Plan

Based on the code review and testing, here's a comprehensive plan to improve the dual camera detector implementation:

## 1. TensorFlow Lite and Edge TPU Integration

### Current Status
- The system is currently using a mock implementation (`DISABLE_TENSORFLOW` is defined)
- The code structure is ready for TensorFlow Lite and Edge TPU integration

### Action Items
1. Follow the steps in `TENSORFLOW_INTEGRATION.md` to integrate TensorFlow Lite
2. Update `CMakeLists.txt` to remove the `DISABLE_TENSORFLOW` definition
3. Ensure proper linking with the Edge TPU library
4. Test with a pre-trained model compatible with Edge TPU

## 2. Performance Optimization

### Current Status
- Camera 1 (index 0): ~9.78 FPS
- Camera 2 (index 2): ~3.96 FPS
- The system is running without hardware acceleration

### Action Items
1. Implement multi-threading optimizations:
   - Adjust thread priorities
   - Optimize the frame queue management
   - Consider using a thread pool for processing
2. Optimize image preprocessing:
   - Reduce resolution if necessary
   - Implement more efficient resizing methods
3. Implement batch processing if supported by the model
4. Profile the code to identify bottlenecks

## 3. Camera Configuration

### Current Status
- Camera 1 (index 0): 1280x720 @ 10 FPS
- Camera 2 (index 2): 1920x1080 @ 5 FPS
- Some camera devices are not capture devices

### Action Items
1. Add camera capability detection to automatically select valid cameras
2. Implement camera configuration options:
   - Allow setting custom resolutions
   - Allow setting custom FPS
3. Add fallback mechanisms for camera failures

## 4. Video Output Improvements

### Current Status
- Video output is saved as MP4 with side-by-side frames
- Small file sizes indicate potential issues with video saving

### Action Items
1. Fix video saving issues:
   - Check codec compatibility
   - Ensure proper frame writing
2. Add options for different output formats
3. Implement timestamp overlay on saved videos
4. Add option to save individual camera feeds separately

## 5. Detection Improvements

### Current Status
- Person detection with confidence threshold
- Basic bounding box visualization

### Action Items
1. Implement tracking to maintain person IDs across frames
2. Add motion detection to trigger alerts
3. Implement zone-based detection (define areas of interest)
4. Add more detection classes beyond just "person"

## 6. User Interface

### Current Status
- Command-line interface with various options
- Basic visualization with OpenCV

### Action Items
1. Implement a simple web interface:
   - Live view of camera feeds
   - Detection history
   - Configuration options
2. Add remote notification capabilities:
   - Email alerts
   - Push notifications
   - Integration with messaging platforms

## 7. Logging and Analytics

### Current Status
- Basic logging of detections and performance
- No long-term analytics

### Action Items
1. Implement structured logging:
   - JSON format for machine readability
   - Rotation policies for log files
2. Add analytics features:
   - Detection counts over time
   - Performance trends
   - Heatmaps of detection locations

## 8. Error Handling and Robustness

### Current Status
- Basic error handling
- Some recovery mechanisms

### Action Items
1. Implement comprehensive error handling:
   - Camera disconnection recovery
   - Model loading failures
   - Resource exhaustion
2. Add system health monitoring:
   - CPU/GPU/TPU usage
   - Memory consumption
   - Temperature monitoring for Edge TPU

## 9. Testing and Validation

### Action Items
1. Implement unit tests for core components
2. Create integration tests for the full pipeline
3. Develop performance benchmarks
4. Test with various lighting conditions and scenarios

## 10. Documentation

### Action Items
1. Update code documentation
2. Create user manual
3. Document API for potential integration with other systems
4. Create deployment guide
